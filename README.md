Introduce and explain multi-class classification with decision trees ðŸŒ³
*Note: this repo is primarily intended for explanatory purposes and prioritizes simplicity over optimality. So, please do reach out when something is unclear or unhelpful*

## 1.1-generate-an-example-classification-data-set
1. Short exploration of sci-kit learn's `make_classification()`
    - A function which generates "synthetic" data sets suitable to classification problems 
2. Generating an example of classifiable web-session data
    - Where we could analyze some typical features of a user's session on a website to predict what page they are ultimately looking for.

## 2.1-understanding-decision-tree-classification
1. Explaining the problem we are trying to solve and the data we'll be working with
2. Brief introduction into what a decision tree is and how it can be used to predict the classification of a record
3. Brief explanation of why you should almost never rely on a single decision tree

## data
- contains a csv generated by 1.1-generate-an-example-classification-data-set.ipynb which simulates a simplified version of a user's session data on a website.

## yml files
- anaconda virtual environment requirements (one for mac os, the other for windows 64)

### Business Requirement: Improve Usability
- Let's suppose we manage a website for an organization which stores and publishes a large quantity of important content. 
- The organization would like to improve the usability of its site to "just work *you know,* the way Amazon or Google does." 
- However, unlike Amazon or Google which can prioritize paid or trending content and allow the rest to be buried at the end of a search result, our organization is committed to improving usability across all of its content even the content that is rarely relevant, because when it is relevant, its crucial. 
- They want a "quick win" an innovation that radically transforms the usability across all the site and attracts new users.
- But it would also be great if you didn't move things around *too* much because their most loyal users already know their way around and get frustrated if they need to learn a whole new layout.

### Proposed Solution: A Content Recomender. 
- A small unobtrusive panel with a short list of "quick links" that takes each user directly to the content they want without having to slog through a long path of clicks, scrolls, and dropdowns and without altering the current structure of the site.
- **We actually are not going to analyze their content and try to correlate it to their search queries**
    - their content is "messy" and hard to access, analyze, or understand
    - their queries are inconsistent
        - they are either "naive" inputs by newcomers accustomed to "google like power"
        - or highly specialize inputs from expert powerusers
- **Instead, we are going to analyze the usage patterns in the the web-session data**
    - and label it according to what content they interacted with
    - The advantages of this data set are 
        - that it is much less likely to have been made "messy" in the past
        - and it is constantly refreshing and updating itself (every time a user uses the sight they add a relevant data record to our set)
